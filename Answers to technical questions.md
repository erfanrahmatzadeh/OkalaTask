1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
I spent approximately 6 hours on the task. If I had more time, I would add user authentication to enhance the application's security.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your language of choice?
One of the most useful features in C# is global using directives, introduced in C# 10. This feature helps simplify code by eliminating repetitive using statements across multiple files.
```
global using System;
global using System.Collections.Generic;
global using System.Threading.Tasks;
```
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
To track down performance issues in production, I typically:

Use logging frameworks like Serilog or NLog to capture detailed application metrics.
Monitor performance with Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools like New Relic or Application Insights.
Perform load testing with tools like k6 to simulate traffic and identify bottlenecks.
In my experience, I have successfully used k6 to identify and resolve performance issues in my code, such as optimizing database queries and reducing API response times.


4. What was the latest technical book you have read or tech conference you have been to? What did you learn?
The last technical book I read was "C# 10 in a Nutshell", which is an excellent resource for mastering modern C#. It helped me:

Deepen my understanding of new features in C# 10, such as global usings, record structs, and file-scoped namespaces.
Improve my ability to write cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code.


5. What do you think about this technical assessment?
The assessment was well-designed and covered a range of technical skills. It allowed me to demonstrate my abilities in:

API integration.
Writing clean, testable code.
Adhering to best practices.
It also provided an opportunity to showcase additional skills like performance testing and designing secure solutions. I believe it aligns well with the technical requirements of the role.
